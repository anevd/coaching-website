          <div class="about-path__paragraph1">I was born in Russia and worked for international sales companies for 15 years. At the last place of work, 30 people worked under my leadership, of course, coaching helped me a lot in the development of employees.</div>

          <div class="about-path__paragraph2">Three years ago I moved to London.</div>

          <div class="about-path__paragraph3">
            I also went through depression when I lay in my bed and did not understand why I should get out of it. She also went through difficult breakups in her personal life. And an unexpected dismissal, when I was left literally without a livelihood, with a mortgage. And the tragic death of someone close to me. And a number of difficult situations in my life, through which, I am sure, each of us goes through. But I can safely say that thanks to coaching, regular therapy and my constant
            self-development, I managed to find my vocation, overcome difficulties in an environmentally friendly way, and realize myself as a woman, wife and mother.
