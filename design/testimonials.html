            The coach directs, asks the right questions in such a way that I, as
            it were, could independently understand what I want and whether I
            really want it. Formulate and prioritize, draw up a plan of action,
            think clearly and act consciously. My thinking has become more
            positive. Throughout the joint communication, inner peace did not
            leave me, faith in my abilities increased, suspiciousness decreased.

            Thank you for being able to identify those beliefs that interfered
            with my life, and not only to identify them, but also taught me to
            work with them, removing all unnecessary from perception and showing
            new opportunities that I lacked for a happy life and work. I really
            liked the style of work: not dreams of the impossible, but how to
            change from within. Each meeting gave impetus to development.

            Thank you very much for the opportunity to talk about such minor
            topics for others and very important for me, for believing in
            yourself after your sessions, for the conviction that you can find a
            way out in any situation, for small, but so significant discoveries
            and revelations for my life. Thank you for taking on this
            challenging task and doing it so well! Good luck to you and us -
            your customers!

            The sessions helped me a lot to remember my skills, look at myself
            and everyday things from the outside, to some extent re-evaluate
            myself. For me, the communication was very productive. In six months
            I was able to build a new business and find happiness in my personal
            life.
